Welcome to the Complete Guide to Affixes in Na'vi!  This is a compilation and expansion on the original forum post from Tirea Aean which detailed every affix in Na'vi.  Here I will expand on this by adding any information that has changed since the original post was edited in 2016 as well as providing three different sorting arrangements of the affixes: first sorted by location (prefix, infix, suffix), then by parts of speech, and finally by productivity vs. non-productivity.\par
Some things to note: firstly, any adposition can be turned into a suffix on the affected noun at will.  For sake of brevity, I have not included these here; if you wish to learn more about adpositions, I suggest Eana Unil's wonderful adpositions document found \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvwZGzPrphqev41y6YhMZ94orWbSPNhpRSxNbysFo80/edit}{here}.
