\section{Introduction}\par

Welcome to the Complete Guide to Affixes in Na'vi!  This is a compilation and expansion on the original forum post from Tirea Aean which detailed every affix in Na'vi and how it is used as well as the implications of the affix.  Here I will expand on this by adding any information that has changed since the original post was edited in 2016.  I will also provide three different sorting arrangements of the affixes: first sorted by location (prefix, infix, suffix), then by parts of speech, and finally by productivity vs. non-productivity.\par
